# Learning C programming
#### Why C programming is awesome ? 
* Its versatility, efficiency and good performance makes it an excellent choice for high complexity data manipulation software, like databases or 3D animation. So let's focus and learn C programming.

#### C, How it work ?
* You need to download and install "Code block" on your local computer(for windows). For Unix and Linux Users, you do not need to install anythings. Just use "Vi" ,"Vim" or "Emacs" Editor integrated with terminal.
* When you write C code in your code editor. The machine does not understand what we write. But then, how does the machine execute code that it does not understand?
All of this happens through a process we call "compilation". 
Compilation is a process by which the machine transforms our source code (which it does not understand) into machine code (code which it is able to understand). And this is how the machine executes our instructions (codes)
* _gcc command is used to compile C file_ as the following syntaxe :
gcc -o _fileNamr_ for example : gcc -o main.c

#### What happens when you type gcc main.c ?
